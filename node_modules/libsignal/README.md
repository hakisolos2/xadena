### libsignal-node

Signal protocol implementation for Node.js based on [libsignal-protocol-javascript](https://github.com/WhisperSystems/libsignal-protocol-javascript).

#### Overview

A ratcheting forward secrecy protocol for secure synchronous and asynchronous messaging.

#### PreKeys

Clients generate signed and unsigned PreKeys, which are sent to the server at install time to facilitate session setup.

#### Sessions

Signal Protocol is session-based. Sessions are established using either:

1. **PreKeyBundles** retrieved from the server.
2. **PreKeySignalMessages** sent by the recipient.

#### State

Clients maintain session state in durable records:

- Identity State (own/others' identity keys)
- PreKey State (generated PreKeys)
- Signed PreKey State
- Session State (for established sessions)
